			<h2> My Black Cat </h2>
			<p> Iverson is his name, jumping around, wilding out is his game, but he wasn't always so big and healthy. It was a cold late September, when a mother of two heard a faint meow coming from near the engine of her car. For warmth, cats will often find their way to a car engine. That cat was very malnourished and for being over 2 months old was very small. After taking him in and giving him a warm place to stay, the mother of two found a place for this very sickly kitten with me.</p> 
			
			<p> The kitten would purr non-stop just at the sight of humans. Knowing he was outside for a while, we took him to a vet who learned he had worms and fleas. After proper treatment and a healthy diet, that cat grew quickly! Iverson is that cat, and he's the cat you see before you today! </p>
			

			<p> You can adopt your own pet at the <a href = "http://cahs-lansing.org/" target="_blank">Lansing Capital Area Humane Society</a>, and bring an animal "<i>Home Fur the Holidays</i>." Lansing CAHS is open:  </p>
