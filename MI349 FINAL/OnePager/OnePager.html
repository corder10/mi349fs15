				<h1> Cats are Love, Cats are Life </h1>	
				
				<p> Each cat, just like each person, has a unique, and possibly interesting, life story. </p>

				<p> To some people, cats are more than just these furry little creatures. Cats are life. Even if you don't own a cat, you can't escape them completely, especially on the internet. They bring a plethora of emotion to the people around them, good and bad. Whether the cat is jumping on the counter, purring in your lap, or trying to eat the food right off of your plate they make us feel some type of way. And my cat had the same effect on me when I first met him and saved his life.</p>
