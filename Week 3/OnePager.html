<p> Ball is life. Even if you don't watch basketball, or don't play basketball, you can't escape the culture completely. </p>


<p>To some people, Basketball is more than just a sport. It's more than just the teams, the players, and the records.
It's the emotion the players and fans feel watching another player get dunked on. The trash talk that happens on and off the court.
The rough and tough play between two great players. Everything from Malice at the Palace to "The Shot." Ball IS Life.
If you don't like basketball, but enjoy competitive play or trash-talking, then this is the website for you.
Here we show everything that makes basketball and the community so unique. </p>
